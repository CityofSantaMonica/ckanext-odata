This CKAN extension provides a basic OData 3.0 endpoint for CKAN.

The endpoint requires data to be held in the CKAN Datastore.
A _Copy OData Endpoint_ link is added to resources on their main dataset page.
The copy to clipboard functionality requires Flash(tm) to be installed
on the users browser.

Installation
